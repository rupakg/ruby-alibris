You will witness the beauty, desirability and dangerous ambition of Dominique Francon. You will reel, stunned, like the millions of other readers who have assured this book a place in the century's history, at the meeting, and mating of these two most powerful creatures in modern America. 'The Fountainhead' is about ambition, power, gold and love ? a love so firm that it triumphed over slander, separation, jealousy, and the cruel assaults of those who sought to destroy it.",

When viewed in the context of fourteen major world ideologies, however, the unique value of its message becomes self-evident. Church History: The foundations of the Western cultural heritage have, to a great extent, been shaped by the convoluted history of the Church. An overview of this subject enables believers to come to terms with the past and face the future with greater confidence. Jewish Origins: Like a magnificent tapestry, the Hebrew tradition delights the senses and feeds the soul. It offers not only refreshing insights, but a compelling ancient beauty. Over ninety original line drawings set the stage for a correlation of New Testament principles with the history, worship, customs, calendar and language of the Jews.",
