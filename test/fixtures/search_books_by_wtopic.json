This book attempts to illuminate every circumstance, internal and external, emotional and technical, involved in the arduous process that culminates in what we see on the big screen.;Only the director knows the background to the scenes, behind every passing frame of film, and the complex series of details and decisions involved, from budget considerations to divine inspiration, from the earliest rehearsal to the final screening. Sidney Lumet's knowledge of the art and craft of directing is considerable, and here he discusses everything from art direction and wardrobe, shooting and editing, the verbal and mechanical soundtracks, to the distribution and marketing of a film and the role of the studio.",

        "synopsis" : "Juarez: The Laboratory of Our Future challenges the propaganda and the realities of the current relationship between the United States and Mexico, focusing on the more intimate connection between the border towns of El Paso and Juarez. Charles Bowden, who first brought attention to the story of the Juarez photographers in Harper's (December 1996), has written an uncompromising, piercing work that combines insightful and informed reporting with a poetic and wry style. His text, integrated with brutal and revealing images by a group of unknown Mexican street photographers, takes on issues of NAFTA, immigration, gangs, corruption, drug trafficking, and poverty, uncovering a very different Mexico than generally depicted in the press, and by the United States and Mexican governments. While Charles Bowden presents a riveting investigation of Juarez, its inhabitants, and its visual chroniclers, the renowned activist and writer Noam Chomsky offers in his introduction a bitingly critical account of NAFTA, suggesting its nullifying effect on democracy and the rights of both workers and consumers, and its underlying strategy for protecting the rich and powerful, and keeping everyone else in his or her place. In his afterword, the Uruguayan author Eduardo Galeano poses the question: Should the Third World really aspire to be like the First World? His insider's look at contemporary North/South American relations reveals how the relationship between Juarez and El Paso can serve as a metaphor for U.S. - Latin American relations, and demonstrates the devastating toll United States policy and attitude knowingly take on human rights and the environment south of our border.",

        "synopsis" : "With its fragile beauty and dark power, the Amazon has fascinated people throughout the centuries. Enthralled by its exotic and impenetrable mystery on his first visit to the region in 1998, Jerry Burchfield sought to utilize his skills as a photographer both to celebrate the Amazon's stunning beauty and also communicate his concern for its future. \"Primal Images\" is the product of his passion, composed of exquisite lumen prints created entirely without a camera or lens. <br>To create his lumens, Burchfield placed plant cuttings directly onto aged black-and-white photographic paper that he secured to the deck of his Amazon boat. He then let the beautifully chaotic interaction of sunlight, rain, temperature, and each plant's inherent moisture and chemistry, among other factors, play out freely in prolonged exposures. The result is an astonishing array of images--from the starkly representational to pure abstractions of color, shape, and form--that powerfully celebrate the rare and resplendent beauty of the world's largest tropical rain forest. <br>Burchfield's photographic technique draws on methods formulated during the origins of photography, beginning with the shadowgrams of nineteenth-century pioneers William Henry Fox Talbot and Anna Atkins and, more recently, twentieth-century innovators Harry Callahan and Robert Heinecken. Yet Burchfield adds a depth to the process that, as Wade Davis writes in his foreword, \"seeks to see beneath the surface of things to the very inner worlds that shamans desire to know.\" <br>\"Jerry Burchfield's images are a testament to the respect in which he holds the natural world. There is a reverence in these photograms that moves them beyond the decorative, outside the scientific, and above the formal. Burchfield quietly collaborates with the form and rhythms of the natural, celebrates the authority and simplicity of his process, and respects the products and demands of time. His images reflect an artmaking sensibility more attuned to discoveries than to dictates.\"--Tim Wride, associate curator of photography, Los Angeles County Museum of Art",

Artist and teacher Richard Kehl used his unique vision to select a series of paintings, photographs, and other media that portray masculinity in a variety of guises. Celebrated men such as Jean Gabin and Gustave Klimt are included, as are many unknown yet compelling faces. The work of fine artists Michelangelo and Rembrandt is presented alongside luminaries from the world of illustration such as N.C. Wyeth and Eleanor Fortescue Brickdale. Anonymous snapshots face carefully composed images - and the two modes enhance one another. Kehl states in his introduction that \"The Masculine proceeds from such masculine inclinations as planned action, focused will, logic, and concrete manifestation.\" These qualities and others are beautifully elucidated in this new book. The Masculine is also available as part of a boxed set with The Feminine (a companion volume).",

Along with his heavy pornographic and sadomasochistic images he also devoted himself to classical genres, such as portraits, nudes, flowers, and still lifes. In the 80s, his work stood for the contemporary psycho-erotic life-style. Like a sculptor he modeled with light the bodies, plants, and objects he portrayed and stylized them into classic sculptures of vivid sensuality. A fascinating combination of strength and grace, his work walks a tightrope: it is hard and romantic, calculating and full of abandon, introverted and extroverted, intimate and theatrical.",
